Brief: Created respository for the Frost Engine.  Frost will be designed as a barebones MMO engine.  It will include a basic client and server.  Initially it will be used as a test bed for research ideas involving three dimensional environmental/artificial life simulations but will hopefully be expanded to be much more robust.
